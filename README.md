The paper gives a literature review of the terms data science and data analytics. A dataset of an online luxury fashion C2C company is presented and analysed in Python. Users of the dataset are segmented in various clusters and basic statistical exploration are done. Findings show that the social features and the passRate are weakly corelated to higher user's sales. The findings are presented to the marketing team with suggestions to further actions. These include a focus on the education of key clusters and to increase the number of active users.
